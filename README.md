# Line Bisection Test (cLBT)

This repository contains the **Computerized Line Bisection Test (cLBT)** — a browser-based assessment tool used to measure visuospatial attention, perceptual biases, and motor accuracy.  
It is commonly used in neurological and neuropsychological research, including studies involving stroke, spatial neglect, and related conditions.

## 📌 Overview

The test displays horizontal lines on an interactive canvas.  
For each trial, the participant marks what they believe is the **center** of the line.

The system automatically records:

- Signed bisection error (negative = leftward bias, positive = rightward bias)  
- Absolute error  
- Standard deviation  
- Closest and farthest marks  
- Summary statistics across all trials  
- CSV export including full data and participant demographics

A researcher can **set the number of trials at the beginning**, allowing flexibility for different study protocols.

## ⚠ Research Validity Notice

The built-in statistical calculations (mean, SD, etc.) are **not independently validated**.  
**Do not rely solely on internal calculations for clinical or research conclusions.**  
Always verify results using your own analysis pipeline.

## 🌐 Cross-Platform Use

The cLBT runs entirely in a web browser — no installation required.

- **Desktop:** use mouse clicks  
- **Mobile / iPad:** use touchscreen taps  
- Fully responsive layout  
- Canvas area enlarged for better visibility on phones and tablets  
- Live errors/stats are placed far below the test area to avoid influencing performance

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Open the test at:

   **https://sd-devsecops.github.io/Line-Bisection-Test/cblt.html**

2. When prompted, enter the number of trials (e.g., 50, 100, 150).

3. For each line:
   - Tap or click the perceived midpoint.

4. When all trials are completed:
   - A form will appear requesting:
     - Name  
     - Surname  
     - Age

5. Press **Download CSV** to save results.  
   The file includes:
   - All trial errors  
   - Signed/absolute deviations  
   - Mean error  
   - Standard deviation  
   - Positive/negative error counts  
   - Closest mark  
   - Biggest miss  
   - Demographic metadata
